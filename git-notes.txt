How to use the terminal to upload to GitHub:

mkdir = Makes a new folder
touch = makes a new file
subl = opens a file with sublime text

Pushing new/edited files:
	git add .
	git commit -m "Enter your comment here"
	git push origin main 
		(if the repository is in another branch, replace "main with the name of it")

Updating Finder after changing/adding on GitHub:
	Go to the repository
	fetch origin
	merge origin/main
		(if the repository is in another branch, replace "main with the name of it")
