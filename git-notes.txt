How to use the terminal to upload to GitHub:

Make sure to have installed git on your computer
Install Homebrew
Install Sublime Text
Make a 

mkdir = Makes a new folder
touch = makes a new file
subl = opens a file with sublime text

Pushing new/edited files:
	navigate to your directory
	git status 
		(see what changes have been made to you project)
	git add .
	git commit -m "Enter your comment here"
	git push origin main 
		(replace main with your branch name) 

Updating Finder after changing/adding on GitHub:
	Go to the repository
	fetch origin
	merge origin/main
		(if the repository is in another branch, replace "main with the name of it")

Clone the GitHub Repository (Open a repository from GitHub onto your finder as a new folder)
	git clone https://github.com/BrynhildurTrausta/repositoryname



Extra things using the command line:
	ls -la = shows how many bytes each item in that folder has and when it 		was made
	cat filename = prints the text file on the screen on the terminal
	sudo = does the next command as the administrated
	yum = package manager
	systemctl = system that manages the services on the machine
	scp = secure copy
	vim filename = is a text editor
	wget = command line program to download things through http
	

Using AWS:

	Making a key-pair:
		ssh-keygen = Generates a new SSH key par which is a public and 		private rsa key pair
		cd ~/.ssh = goes into that directory (~ goes into a directory)
		cat id_rsa.pub = prints the key pair in text on the screen.
			Next step is to copy that text, go to aws, import key pair and paste it


	After making an instance on AWS, copy the IP address and go to terminal and say ssh ec2-user@ipaddress (ssh ec2-user@18.234.72.125). Then you are connected to the instance
	To go in it you say vim index.html. Then you are in the file
	i = insert
	esc = gets out of the insert
	:wq = saves and quit (:qq = does not save, only quits)
	cat index.html
	sudo yum install httpd = installs everything you need to open it up
	sudo systemctl start httpd.service
	sudo systemctl status httpd.service (press q to get back to the command line)
	Now go to chrome and make a new tab and paste your ip address. You should see the auto web page made from aws
	Sudo cp index.html	/var/www/html/ = copies the file into the web page with the ip address (into the web server).
	Now you should see the html page you made in index.

	Tip: Make a file in your home directory then copy it to your desired loation

	scp ec2-user@18.234.72.125:~/index.html .
